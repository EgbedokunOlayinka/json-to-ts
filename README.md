# @theewave/json-to-ts-cli

This is a simple CLI tool that helps to convert JSON data to typescript interfaces. It can take the JSON data from terminal input or from a file and then output the converted typescript interfaces to a file or to the terminal.

## Installation

To install the package, use the following command:

```shell
npm install @theewave/json-to-ts-cli
```

## Usage

To use the package in your project, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the package in your terminal everytime you want to convert JSON data to TS:

This will spin up a command-line wizard that will take you through the simple conversion process.
